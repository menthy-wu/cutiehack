Cutie Saves the World was the second-place entry into Cutie Hack, a 12-hour hackathon at the University of California, Riverside. It is a 2D plaformer, built in Unity, with the theme of cleaning up pollution and making the world a little better. The player character Cutie can traverse the dank, dark world and defeat plastic bags and oil spills with their leaf projectiles. All assets and the game itself were built by our team of four first years: Mengxuan Wu, Rose Wong, Amelia Schoch, and Aditi Thanekar.
